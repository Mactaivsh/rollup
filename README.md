# Rollup-Legacy

This is a fork repo from the official [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)

Any usage and bugs related question please go to the offical repo

## Why we need this repo

Since **v0.60.0** rollup had deprecated IE 8 support, and we still need to get IE 8 compatible version of our js library builds.

But we also want to build a version without supporting IE 8. Howerver, as we know, different versions of npm packages are not allowed in the same repo, so there it is.

> we use v0.59.4 of rollup in this pacakge
